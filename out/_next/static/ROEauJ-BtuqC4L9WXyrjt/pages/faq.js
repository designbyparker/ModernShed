Our clients have turned their modern Sheds into home offices, art studios, guest cottages, man caves, fitness rooms, music studios, garden sheds and more. Checkout our stories at www.modernshedblog.com"},{"question_id":"2","question":"How long does it take to install a Modern Shed?","answer":"A: Allow approximately four to five of manufacturing time once ordered (plans approved). Shipping/delivery time depends on your location. After that, installation should take no more than several days, depending on the size of your structure. A typical 10x12 size structure takes 3-4 days, whereas a larger 16x40 may take a few weeks depending on permitting/inspections"},{"question_id":"3","question":"Do we need a permit to build a Modern-Shed?","answer":"A: In many cities and jurisdictions, you can place a Modern-Shed without a permit based on size and location. Please check with your local building jurisdiction to find out any zoning/set-back/building restrictions or guidelines. Modern-Shed structures are designed and with certain options, are 100% permit-able; even in the strictest building code jurisdiction of Los Angeles, CA. Your Modern-Shed representative will assist you in designing your Modern-Shed to meet the exact requirements needed for your area."},{"question_id":"4","question":"Can Modern-Sheds be installed with electricity and plumbing?","answer":"A: Yes. Ask your Modern-Shed representative about options to connect your Modern-Shed with utilities. We pre-drill all of our framing units to accommodate electrical wires. Final electrical work is completed by installers on site. Modern-Shed will soon be partnering with a solar company to give you even more flexibility."},{"question_id":"5","question":"Do Modern-Sheds need a foundation?","answer":"A: Not in the traditional sense. Modern-Sheds ordered without our unique floor sytem can be placed on a poured slab or by using our unique (can be pre-insultated), panelized floor system can be installed with minimal ground work. We have developed several systems that meet local building code and adapt to uneven grade with minimal site work required."},{"question_id":"6","question":"Do Modern-Sheds come painted?","answer":"A: Yes, we offer the highest quality paint from Benjamin Moore\xae as an option, which we do at our manufacturing facility for our customers\u2019 convenience."},{"question_id":"7","question":"How much does a Modern-Shed cost per square foot?","answer":"A: Modern-Sheds vary enormously in size, design and options, all of which affect cost. Therefore we never quote a per square foot price. Come to us with your idea. We\u2019ll discuss options with you and create a structure/price to meet your budget. Please ask your local Modern-Shed representative for more details."}]')},csvi:function(e,o,n){"use strict";n.r(o);var t=n("q1tI"),i=n.n(t),s=n("F+yL"),a=n("29Fh"),r=n("kjMO"),d=n("2D7l"),u=n("d3iy"),l=n("8Kt/"),c=n.n(l),h=n("CBmx"),p=(n("0dbx"),i.a.createElement);o.default=function(){var e=Object(t.useState)("show"),o=e[0],n=e[1];return Object(t.useEffect)((function(){setTimeout((function(){return n("hide")}),2e3)})),p(i.a.Fragment,null,p(c.a,null,p("title",null,"Modern Shed | FAQ")),p("section",{id:"faq-page",className:"aux-page"},p("h1",null,"FAQ"),p(d.a,{navClass:"aux-nav"}),p(u.a,null),p(h.a,{page:"FAQ",show:o}),p("section",{className:"aux-section"},p("div",{className:"aux-deck"},s.map((function(e){return p("div",{key:e.question_id},p("h4",null,e.question),p("p",null,e.answer))})))),p(r.a,null),p(a.a,null)))}},"l//U":function(e,o,n){(window.__NEXT_P=window.__NEXT_P||[]).push(["/faq",function(){return n("csvi")}])}},[["l//U",0,2,1,3,4]]]);
