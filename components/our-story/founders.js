      Our founders, a husband and wife architect team, discovered a simple answer to their lack of room: less a shed, and more a stylish, peaceful getaway tucked neatly into their backyard.
      <br/><br/><br/>
      When Ryan Grey Smith and Ahna Holder purchased their dream home, a 1940s era house in Seattle, they were met with an unforeseen obstacle. Their new house lacked a garage, a basement, and an attic. Without any storage space indoors, the couple looked outsideâ€”and solved the issue with a shed. Their story and creation became the foundation of their business, and Modern-Shed launched in 2005. Ryan and Ahna have been offering seamless solutions to construct innovative, eco-friendly, and inexpensive living spaces for their clients around the country ever since.
