              <p>Modern-Shed was born from builders and dreamers—idealists and pragmatic problem-solvers. We build intentionally crafted backyard studios, by connecting the dots between form and function. Our answer to living in a limited space lies a few steps outside your door, whether it’s a home office tucked back by the garden, a guest room decorated with sunlight, a dedicated place of movement and meditation, or a studio meant for photography, writing, painting, or any interest that doesn’t quite fit across the kitchen table. In our endeavor to create a thoughtful addition to your home, we bring in our cost-effective and design-friendly expertise, rather than opting for a costly renovation. We could all use a little more space to grow—let it be created specifically for you, a room of possibility and plenty.
