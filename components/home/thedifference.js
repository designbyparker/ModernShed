          <h2>The Difference</h2>
          <p><b>(A)</b> In typical construction, it takes an all-hands-on-deck approach. Your project might require a building designer, architect, structural engineer, or a general contractor, leading to not only a high price tag, but a yard that is transformed into a construction zone. From sawdust to large scraps to trampled landscaping, we’re seeking to step right on over the mess.<br/><b>(B)</b> With Modern-Shed, pre-frabricated, carry-by-hand panels arrive at your doorstep. The materials assemble quickly and easily by your handy-person or one of our install teams with minimal waste and clean up. Battah-bing, battah-boom. Let’s make it even easier: panels are constructed indoors so your lumber isn’t sitting out in the rain for weeks. And not to brag, but our materials are the best of the best in terms of quality. </p>
