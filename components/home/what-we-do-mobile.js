              <p>We build intentionally crafted spaces for multi-functional use, by connecting the dots between form and function. Modern-Shed was born from builders and dreamers—idealists and pragmatic problem-solvers. Our answer to living in a limited space lies a few steps outside your door, whether that’s a home office tucked back by the garden, a guest room decorated with sunlight, a studio meant for photography, writing, painting, or any interest that doesn’t seem to fit across the kitchen table. We could all use a little more room to grow.</p>
