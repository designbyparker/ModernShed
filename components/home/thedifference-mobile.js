        <p><b>(A)</b> In typical construction, it takes an all-hands-on-deck approach. Your project might require a building designer, architect, structural engineer, or a general contractor, leading to not only a high price tag, but a yard that is transformed into a construction zone. From sawdust to large scraps to trampled landscaping, we’re seeking to step right on over the mess.<b>(B)</b> With Modern-Shed, pre-frabricated, carry-by-hand panels arrive at your doorstep. The materials assemble quickly and easily by your handy-person or one of our install teams with minimal waste and clean up. Battah-bing, battah-boom. Let’s make it even easier: panels are constructed indoors so your lumber isn’t sitting out in the rain for weeks. And not to brag, but our materials are also of the highest possible quality. </p>
